              BOGOR â€“ Opening 2024 with two competitions that could be
              considered new, IYSA and the Faculty of Food Science and
              Technology IPB successfully held GYIIF and IYMIA for the second
              time. Once again held in Bogor, GYIIF and IYMIA succeeded in

              Even though at this event there were no participants from abroad
              taking part in the offline competition, what was great about this
              competition could be said that we had participants from Sabang to
              Merauke because we had participants from Jambi and Sorong, not
              just one team but several teams came directly to Bogor!
            </p>
            <p className="card-text col-sm-7">
              This time GYIIF and IYMIA were attended by 341 teams which were
              divided into 272 teams participating in the GYIIF event and 69
              teams participating in the IYMIA event. All participants came from
              14 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan,
